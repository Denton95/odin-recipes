        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I made this lemon garlic chicken randomly and it was delicious.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder, divided</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper; place in melted butter. Cook chicken, flipping frequently, until browned, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon garlic powder over chicken; cook for 2 minutes. Flip and sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon garlic powder on the second side; cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour lemon juice over each side of chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
